# Hello world

Lets try some examples

* Hello world

```shell
echo "Hello world"
```

* Try a command with some output, say list files in this directory

```shell
ls -l
```

* How about setting a variable and using it later
```shell
TMPDIR=/tmp/
```

* List TMPDIR
```shell
ls -l $TMPDIR
```

* Running sudo
```shell
sudo whoami
```
